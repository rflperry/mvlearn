Integrating mvlearn with scikit-learn
=====================================

`mvlearn` mimics most of `scikit-learn` API, and integrates seamlessly with
it. In scikit-learn, a dataset is represented as a 2d array `X` of shape
`(n_samples, n_features)`. In `mvlearn`, datasets `Xs` are lists of views,
which are themselves 2d arrays of shape `(n_samples, n_features_i)`. The
number of features does not have to be constant:

# Create the data
# ---------------

n_samples = 100
n_features1 = 20
n_features2 = 30

X1 = np.random.randn(n_samples, n_features1)
X2 = np.random.randn(n_samples, n_features2)
Xs = [X1, X2]

# Here, `Xs` is a multiview dataset, containing two views. `mvlearn` works
# with these objects.

###############################################################################
# ViewTransformer
# ---------------
#
# `mvlearn.preprocessing.ViewTransformer` is a handy tool to apply the same
# `sklearn` transformer to each view of the multiview dataset. For instance, it
# is simple to apply PCA to each view. In the following, we reduce the
# dimension of each view to 3:


pca = PCA(n_components=3)
mvpca = ViewTransformer(pca)
Xs_transformed = mvpca.fit_transform(Xs)
print(len(Xs_transformed))
print([X.shape for X in Xs_transformed])

# The PCA is applied to each view with the `mvpca` transformer, and the output
# of PCA, `Xs_transformed`, is a multiview dataset, where each view now has
# `3`features.
#
# Importantly, it is possible to apply a different transform to each view, by
# passing a list to `ViewTransformer`. For instance, if we want to keep 5
# components in the second dataset, we can do:


pca2 = PCA(n_components=5)
mvpca = ViewTransformer([pca, pca2])
Xs_transformed = mvpca.fit_transform(Xs)
print(len(Xs_transformed))
print([X.shape for X in Xs_transformed])

###############################################################################
# Mergers
# -------
#
# At the end of a multiview machine learning pipeline, it is sometimes needed
# to transform the multiview dataset in a single view dataset. All `sklearn`
# methods can then be used on this single view dataset. Mergers make this task
# simple.
#
# A simple way to transform a multiview dataset in a single view dataset is
# simply by stacking each features. The class
# `mvlearn.preprocessing.ConcatMerger` implements this:


merge = ConcatMerger()

X_transformed = merge.fit_transform(Xs)
print(X_transformed.shape)

# This allows for simple integration in scikit-learn pipelines.

# Pipeline Example: group-ICA
# ---------------------------
#
# As a simple illustration, we now show how easy it is to code group
# independent component analysis (groupICA) from scratch using `mvlearn`.
#
# We use the group ICA of *Calhoun et al. "A method for making group
# inferences from functional MRI data using independent component analysis.",
# Human brain mapping 14.3 (2001): 140-151.* as reference.
#
# GroupICA takes a multiview dataset, and tries to extract from it some shared
# independent sources. In its usual formulation, it consists of three simple
# steps:
#
# - Apply an individual PCA to each view
# - Concatenate the features of each view
# - Apply usual ICA on the concatenated features
#
# This is easily implemented using `mvlearn` and scikit-learn pipelines:


n_components = 2
individual_pca = ViewTransformer(PCA(n_components=n_components))
merge = ConcatMerger()
ica = FastICA(n_components=n_components)

groupica = Pipeline([('individual pca', individual_pca),
                     ('concatenate', merge),
                     ('ica', ica)])

X_transformed = groupica.fit_transform(Xs)
print(X_transformed.shape)

# Here, `Xs` contains Gaussian noise, so nothing of value is extracted.
# However, if each view consists of a linear transform of some independent
# sources, it works as intended:


time = np.linspace(0, 1, 1000)
source1 = np.cos(20 * time)
source2 = np.sin(50 * time)
S = np.c_[source1, source2]
A1 = np.random.randn(3, 2)
A2 = np.random.randn(4, 2)
X1 = np.dot(S, A1.T) + .1 * np.random.randn(1000, 3)
X2 = np.dot(S, A2.T) + .1 * np.random.randn(1000, 4)
Xs = [X1, X2]
plt.figure()
plt.plot(time, source1, time, source2)
plt.title('Sources')

plt.figure()
for x in X1.T:
    plt.plot(time, x)
plt.title('signals')

X_transformed = groupica.fit_transform(Xs)

for x in X_transformed.T:
    plt.plot(time, x)
plt.title('recovered signals')
