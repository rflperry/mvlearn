def random_subspace_method(X, n_features=None, n_views=1):
    """
    Random Subspace Method [#1RSM]_ for constructing multiple views.
    Each view is constructed by randomly selecting n_features
    (columns) from X. All unselected features are set to 0.

    Parameters
    ----------
    X : array-like matrix, shape (n_samples, n_cols)
        The input samples.

    n_features : int, float
        Number (or proportion, if float) of features to randomly select.

        - If int, then n_features is the number of columns to select.

        - If float, then n_features*n_cols is the number of columns to select.

    n_views : strictly positive int, float optional (default = 1)
        Number of views to construct.

    Returns
    -------
    Xs : list of array-likes matrices
        - Xs length: n_views
        - Xs[i] shape: (n_samples, n_features)
